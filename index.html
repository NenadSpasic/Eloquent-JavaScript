    can be referenced only in that function,

    only functions created new scopes, so old-style bindings, created with 
    the var keyword, are visible throughout the whole function that they

    the block in the example. The exception is when multiple bindings have 
    the same name—in that case, code can see only the innermost one. For 
    example, when the code inside the halve function refers to n, it is
