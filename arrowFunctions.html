        // Arrow functions

        //There’s a third notation for functions, which looks very different from 

        //the others. Instead of the function keyword, it uses an arrow (=>) 

        //made up of an equal sign and a greater-than character (not to be confused with the greater-than-or-equal operator, which is written >=)

        const power = (base, exponent) => {
            let result = 1;
            for (let count =0; count < exponent; count++) {
                result *= base;
            }
            return result;
        };
        
        console.log (power (2,10));
         //The arrow comes after the list of parameters and is followed by the 
         //function’s body. It expresses something like 
         //“this input (the parameters) produces this result (the body)”.

        /*
        The place where the computer stores this context is the call stack. 
        Every time a function is called, the current context
         stored on top of this stack. 
         When a function returns, it removes the top context
          from the stack and uses that context to continue
           execution.
