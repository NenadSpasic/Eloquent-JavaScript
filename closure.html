/*
The ability to treat functions as values, combined with the fact that local 
bindings are re-created every time a function is called, brings up an 
interesting question. What happens to local bindings when the function 
call that created them is no longer active?


This feature—being able to reference a specific instance of a local binding
 in an enclosing scope—is called closure.
  A function that references bindings from
   local scopes around it is called a closure.
    This behavior not only frees you from having 
    to worry about lifetimes of bindings but also
     makes it possible to use function values in
      some creative ways.
